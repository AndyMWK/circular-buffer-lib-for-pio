## Project Overview
I was inspired by the work I did at my Co-Op and decided to make a general library that implements a circular buffer that can be downloaded and used on Platform IO. 

### NOTE
The code uses Arduino.h so one must be using the Arduino framework. Only the function that prints all elements of the queue uses anything related to Arduino, the serial monitor. So the libaray will not be reliant on Arduino if that feature is removed and replaced with something else. 

## Current Progress
I still need to do more testing and expand my familiarity with using templates in C++.
